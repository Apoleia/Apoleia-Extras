      <description><![CDATA[I think it is honestly time to add RSS support for my website, so I can do posts directly on my website. Since a majority of the web isn't exactly aware that Neocities has a social media-like aspect on its main site, where you can comment on people's walls, like posts, see updates, etc. So, I've decided to finally move everything to this side. On occassion, I'll still post on the main site, since most folk in the community still look at it. But yeah, RSS baby!!!!]]></description>
